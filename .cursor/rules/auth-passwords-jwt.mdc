## Auth – Argon2 passwords and JWT tokens

- Use **Argon2** for password hashing; never store plain or weakly hashed passwords.
- Use **JWT tokens** for stateless authentication; prefer short-lived access tokens with refresh strategy if needed.
- Keep auth logic thin and well-tested: registration, login, token issuing, and verification should be small, focused functions.
- Store only secure identifiers and minimal user info in JWT payloads; avoid sensitive data in tokens.
