## Backend stack – TypeScript, Fastify, GraphQL

- Use **TypeScript + Fastify** as the primary HTTP server; no other backend frameworks.
- Expose the app via **Apollo Server integration with Fastify**; primary interface is GraphQL, not ad-hoc REST.
- Let the **GraphQL schema** describe the public API; keep resolvers, loaders, and validation close to each feature slice.
- Prefer vertical slices: group Fastify setup, Apollo integration, resolvers, and loaders for a feature near each other.
