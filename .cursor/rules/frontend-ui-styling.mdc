## Frontend UI – shadcn/ui and Tailwind

- Use **shadcn/ui** components as the base design system where possible.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling; minimize custom global CSS.
- Use **semantic Tailwind color tokens** (e.g. `bg-primary`, `text-muted`) instead of raw color names, and map these to the app’s look.
- Co-locate component files, styles, and story/demo files within the same feature slice.
