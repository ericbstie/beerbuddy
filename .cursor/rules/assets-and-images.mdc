## Assets and images – S3 / Firestore buckets

- Store static images (post photos, avatars) in an **S3-compatible bucket or Firestore storage**, not on the app server filesystem.
- Prefer pre-signed URLs or secure tokens for upload and access; keep buckets private by default.
- Store only references (URLs, keys, metadata) in the database; the binary data lives in the bucket.
- Keep upload, processing, and URL generation logic close to the features that use the images.
