## Mise as tool manager

- **Use mise**: Treat `mise` as the default tool/runtime manager for this repo. Prefer `mise` over per-language tool managers when possible.
- **Honor config**: Use `mise.toml` in the project root as source of truth for runtimes, tools, and tasks; avoid ad-hoc installs that bypass it.
- **Read docs first**: Before running any `mise` command (install, run, sync, etc.), use a web-search tool to open current mise docs (for example `https://mise.jdx.dev`) or relevant pages and skim behavior, flags, and examples.
- **Be explicit**: When suggesting commands, show full `mise` invocations aligned with the docs, not half-remembered or outdated syntax.
