## Data layer – PostgreSQL with Prisma

- Use **PostgreSQL** as the only primary database.
- Use **Prisma** as the ORM and migration tool; treat `schema.prisma` as source of truth for relational data.
- Prefer Prisma client over raw SQL; use raw queries only when Prisma cannot express what is needed.
- Keep Prisma models and related resolvers / repositories close to their feature slices.
