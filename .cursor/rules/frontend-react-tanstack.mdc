## Frontend app – React, Vite, TanStack

- Use **React + TypeScript** with **Vite** as the build tool.
- Use **TanStack Router** for routing; avoid other routing libraries.
- Use **TanStack Query** for server state and data fetching, wired to the GraphQL API.
- Use **TanStack Virtual** for infinite scrolling feeds (Home, Explore, etc.).
- Keep feature routes, queries, components, and state close together in vertical slices.
