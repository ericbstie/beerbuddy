## Code generation and API types

- Use GraphQL **code generation** to produce TypeScript types for operations and schema on the frontend (and backend where useful).
- Consume generated types in React components, hooks, and TanStack Query calls; avoid hand-written duplicates of API shapes.
- Regenerate types whenever the GraphQL schema or operations change; keep codegen config in version control.
- Prefer strongly-typed APIs end-to-end to catch breaking changes early.
