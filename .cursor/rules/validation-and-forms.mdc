## Validation and forms – Zod + TanStack Form

- Use **Zod** as the primary validation library for user input; avoid ad-hoc manual validation.
- Use **TanStack Form** to wire Zod schemas into form state and validation flows.
- Share validation logic between backend and frontend where practical; keep schemas close to their feature slices.
- Treat validation as a first-class concern: fail fast with clear, user-facing error messages.
